# gesha-slider-1

My ever created first slider. 

I am taking a course (Web Authoring using Adobe Dreamweaver), and I have to develop a site from client questionary to hosting. Though my client gave up the business, I started my project for a real customer. We decided to show the products in a slideshow because there are relatively a huge number of goods we were not going to build a webshop. First, we bought a slider, but after I decided to create my own. The real challenge was to build the slider including an image beside with text in a slide.

I know it is not a big deal for experienced developers, but I am happy that I could do this as I am still a greenhorn "here."

Welcome comments.
